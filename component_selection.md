# Component selection

- Happens after generating requirements
- Need to have an idea of the shape of the device
- Use reputed component suppliers
- Need to think about component volumes, support, regulatory requirements, cost, etc.
- Never expect to get it right first time
    - There will be multiple iterations
    - There will be guess work (Specially during initial stages)
- Famous component suppliers [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com), [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com), [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com)
- Process also depends on the scale of the organization

    1. RTC


## Selecting an accelerometer

- Let's select an accelerometer for a wearable device


## Selecting a temperature sensor

- Let's select a temperature sensor with:
    - 0.1 C temperature resolution
    - 1.8 V to 3.3 V power supply range
    - I2C communication
