# Component selection

- Happens after generating requirements
- Need to have an idea of the shape of the device
- Use reputed component suppliers
- Need to think about component volumes, support, regulatory requirements, cost, etc.
- Never expect to get it right first time
    - There will be multiple iterations
    - There will be guess work
- Famous component suppliers [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com), [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com), [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com)
