# Schematic Design

- In this section we are going to look at how to start a design using a microcontroller
- Going to focus on what resources to refer for such a design


## Looking at reference designs

- A reference design is a gateway to any schematic design
- First focus on following three areas
    1. How to load the firmware?
    1. How to apply power?
    1. How to boot?

    - [STM32F407]()
    - [ATMega328P]()
    - [MSP430]()
    - [iMX8Q]()

## Electronics knowledge requirement

- Need to be comfortable with basic Electronics components
    - Resistor
    - Capacitos
    - Inductor
    - Diode
    - Transistor
- No need to have advanced Electronics knowledge for most of the designs
- Power supply circuit is the most common analog heavy design
- Ability to understand datasheets is a must
- For more complex designs, it is vital to know advanced Electronics theories (Ex: High speed designs, impedance matching, etc.)
